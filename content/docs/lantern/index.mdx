# Instalation

At the time of writing this docs, there's no way to install Atheja yet. However, there are planned at least two ways to install it - using Docker and from source.

## From source

It is recommended to use PHP 8.2.12, as this is the version that Atheja is builded on.

1) Firstly, install Git

```bash tab="Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi OS"
$ sudo apt install git
```

```bash tab="Fedora/CentOS/RHEL"
$ sudo dnf install git
```

TODO: Next steps

## Using Docker Compose

1) Firstly, install Docker using a [Docker guide](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).
2) Secondly, create a folder, where the containers will live (for example in `/opt/` on Linux).
3) Thirdly, create a file `docker-compose.yaml` and insert following content

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  atheja:
    container_name: atheja # change as needed
    image: Lantern-Lighthouse/Atheja
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '80:80'
    # volumes:
      # - ToDo
```

4) Fourthly, start the container using

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
